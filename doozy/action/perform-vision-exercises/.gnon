So if you're not willing to do that, don't bother.\" And even if you do put in the work, the evidence suggests that you will still need glasses.\n\nThese simple exercises will help you maintain optimal vision and may also keep those annoying eye floaters at bay. Perform these exercises first thing in the morning, before bedtime, or any time your eyes feel fatigued. Make sure that your hands are clean and that your mood is relaxed. Commit to daily practice and you may just see better results within one month. \nWarm your eyes. Rub your palms together to create heat, and then place them against your eyes for five seconds. Repeat this three times. \nRoll your eyes. Start by looking up and then slowly circle 10 times clockwise and 10 times counterclockwise. \nFocus. Hold a pen at arm's length, focus your eyes on it, and slowly bring the pen closer until it's about 6 inches away from your nose. Then slowly move it back, keeping your eyes focused on the pen, 10 times in all. \nMassage your temples. Using your thumb knuckles, massage your temples in small circles, 20 times in one direction and 20 in the other. Repeat the same actions above the mid-point of the eyebrows at the forehead, then below the eyes on both sides of the bridge of the nose. \nTake a mini-nap. Put your head back, close your eyes, and relax for 3 minutes. ",
