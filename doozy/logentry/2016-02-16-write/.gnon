    "details": "I've decided that as much as i feel that conversation is most often unnecessary, if not painfully boring, i'm going to start practicing the art of the BRO.\nI will watch stupid sportsing games and small-talk, i will high five and be excited when a stranger on the television does some awesome sportsing maneuver.\nDon't worry, i'm going to use my powers for good. My goal is to find angel investors that believe in my vision for software that helps people, and i'm not going to find investors by talking to my dog. I must morph into \"BROGRAMMER\"\n=========================\n99% of the time that i find myself attracted to someone, i talk myself out of acting on it only to protect them from myself. My ex fiance tried to ruin my life because she felt emotionally destroyed when i left to Colorado (the first time), and i hesitate to let anyone depend on me sticking around, only to get hurt in the end.",
