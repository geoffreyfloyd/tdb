Perhaps i need to explore this false logic further, and explore the benefits of unraveling this false logic.\n\n# Alcohol Destroys Moderation\nBefore i started drinking daily, i still drank coffee and smoked marijuana, and i do not recall having any trouble sleeping, or remaining asleep. Perhaps quitting coffee is not the answer, but instead, quitting alcohol (replacing alcohol with conscious breathing and movement exercises) and regaining a sense of moderation in my other habits.",
