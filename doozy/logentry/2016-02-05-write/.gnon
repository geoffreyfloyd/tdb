I don't get frustrated very easily, but when i feel like someone is flogging a dead horse and arguing semantics with me, i just get to the point where i don't want to talk about it anymore.\n============\nNot sure i'm cut out for managing; feel bad and a little depressed that i snapped at one of the new developer's today. I should have had more patience, but when i feel like someone is arguing with me over semantics; and over a topic that i've been studying for the last 6 months, while they've been studying it for a day, there is only so much i can take.\n============\nI'd like to think that i like people, but after my first week of having to manage and train someone, and basically talk ALL DAMN DAY, i realize i like the IDEA of people, and i love when they do amazing things, but in practice, i don't really care to interact with them, or at least not more than a few minutes at a time. Yet somehow i'm driven to spend the majority of my free life writing software in the hopes to help them. I can only pretend to understand myself any more than anyone else rightfully claims to.\n============\nif you ever get a clean build of a code project on your first try compiling after hours of coding over a span of 7 beers and, oh wait it's my hit............. But ya...... wait, what was i saying?","entry":"performed"}
