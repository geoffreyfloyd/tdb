    "details": "Every time Bernie calls out Hillary on her falsehoods, my soul cries out in absolute glee. There are so many good and sensible people out there, people incorruptible by money, that bear a deep and true love of humanity in their hearts and command the rational sensibilities required to make well-informed decisions on their behalf.\nUnfortunately, these people rarely get involved in politics, and when they do, they never get further than the city or county level, because when you get to the state level, corporate interests are inevitably involved.\nPerhaps our culture should be recognizing these people and urging them into positions in their communities, and following their path every step of the way. As a culture, it seems to me that we give so much love and energy to artists, for the realities they bring to life, and all but ignore these do-gooders, who are pouring their energy into making their small part of the world a better. I wonder how many of these politicians got involved with the best of intentions, but then only faced a life of hearing from the 'OTHER' crowd, akin to that old adage, \"Did right twice, heard it never. Did wrong once, heard it ever.\"\n=======\nLarge and complex ideas need an entire basis of smaller ideas to get to it, it cannot easily pass the most basic transitions between one idea and the next. This thought comes to mind while discussing how we both used to like Creed. We were at a different point in our lives, and we thought it was so deep. But our ideas of spirituality have grown past it to an extent that it is no longer relevant to us.\nIn an economy of thought, we must not forget that there are often a slew of ideas one must slowly buy into before they can begin to fathom some of the greater, and more complex, ideas. In this light, we must not be so quick to judge simpler, or perhaps not as accurate, ideas as completely irrelevant. Sometimes a flawed model is necessary for bridging an acceptable amount of complexity between already established ideas and this new idea.",
