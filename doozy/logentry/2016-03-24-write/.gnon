    "details": "#IMPORTANT MUSICIAN/PROGRAMMER MERGER IDEA\nAll my songs should be Gnodes, they change over time and show the history of a song, an idea, what it came from, even include links to inspirations and related ideas, poems, writings, etc.\n=================\nYou can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.\nThis once meant something to me about stubbornness, but these days I think of the blindness to opportunity that some hold. Actually, blindness isn't the right word, it's SEEING it, and coming up with reasons why it's not worth seizing.\nIt's like leading a (talking) horse to water, and although the horse is thirsty, it insists that it will drink later.",
