    "details": "I feel like i am more often hopeful of the future than not, and willing to be a cog in a system i know must get better. However, sometimes my disdain for modern society is paralyzingly debilitating, and i'm overcome with the gap between a life that is physiologically healthful and the current state of the modern lifestyle. I was going to ride the bicycle to work, and perhaps i still should, but part of me feels like as soon as i taste that fresh air and sunshine, i'm just going to keep riding and riding until my bones turn to dust, and it'd be an infinitely more purposeful life than being a part of this disease.",
