Instead of getting one already decked out, decided to focus on the exact color, body, condition, and base components i wanted and then build it out custom to my needs. Should also hear back from Boulder Offroad sometime tomorrow with an estimate to do the 4WD conversion with a 6\" lift and 35\" tires. If it's the dollar amount i'm guessing, i'll be waiting til i get my bonus in December before that happens, but in the meantime, it's still a solid camper van.\n===\nGuy selling the van wanted 15K, we shook on 13K, and we're meeting up at the bank tomorrow to make the exchange. I'm excited to hear back from Boulder Offroad with a quote to do the lift and 4WD conversion, i'm guessing it's going to be about 12K (ouch). Then about 1.5K for the solar panels, inverter, and deep cycle batteries.",
