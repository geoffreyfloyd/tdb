Instead of getting one already decked out, decided to focus on the exact color, body, condition, and base components i wanted and then build it out custom to my needs. Should also hear back from Boulder Offroad sometime tomorrow with an estimate to do the 4WD conversion with a 6\" lift and 35\" tires. If it's the dollar amount i'm guessing, i'll be waiting til i get my Ben, definitely making it out to visit you and your family in the Sierra Nevadas in December.",
