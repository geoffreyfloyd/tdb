I found that the DataMember(EmitDefaultValue=False) attribute setting was the culprit. I forked the source for Newtonsoft.Json library on github, and found that EmitDefaultValue was only referenced in one line; commenting it out would disable this functionality cleanly without any other unintended consequences. All was right in the universe. Then i went down the path of building it and referencing it in the Server project...\n\n4 hours later i was stuck deep in \"dependency hell\" between ASP.NET libs and Newtonsoft-Json, trying multiple ways to get through and around it, but what should have been a simple quick-fix had turned into a long, cold journey that still had no sure end in sight.\n\nI took a step back and it occurred to me that whatever solution we come up with for client-side validation client side would be just as useful for giving us a blank model that can be used to 'fill in the blanks', and in this perspective, the serialization behavior that i was trying to remove actually looks more like the beneficial performance gain it is, instead of an annoying hindrance to getting a reliable model-shape to the client side.\n\nAfter that, i patched up the model shape with the missing variables and added/categorized/populated most of the main form inputs so i could feel like i got some work accomplished, instead of leaving off feeling frustrated and unsatisfied with my day.","entry":"performed"}
