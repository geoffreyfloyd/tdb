To my thinking, 'luck' is little more than being skilled at recognizing and attracting opportunity. For me, it comes from running through possible futures in my mind, realistic futures that i then look for the door to intercept the here and now with where i want to be, navigating through the obstacles in my path.\nStill, i have to admit that i've reaped much more than i've sown, which is really putting it lightly; i've salted the earth of my life and still it grew to new heights.\nThat isn't to justify such behavior. I have no illusion that a life of self-destructive behavior would stand the test of time. These days my energy comes from a place of self-love, where before my efforts came in large part from a deep-seated hatred of my self.\n====\ni had this experience on the twin lake trail where i felt so incredibly light, and perfectly centered and balanced, as if it were almost an unnecessary formality for my feet to touch the ground as i glided over the trail.\nI got so excited that i fell out of the that state, and never got back to the feeling nearly as intensely. But i know i will again, soon.\n======\nwe should subsidize enlightenment","entry":"performed"}
