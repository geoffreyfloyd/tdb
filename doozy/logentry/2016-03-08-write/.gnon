    "details": "Luck is somewhat of a dirty word to me. To my thinking, 'luck' is little more than being skilled at recognizing and attracting opportunity. For me, it comes from running through possible futures in my mind, realistic futures that i then look for the door to intercept the here and now with where i want to be, navigating through the obstacles in my path.\nStill, i have to admit that i've reaped much more than i've sown, which is really putting it lightly; i've salted the earth of my life and still it grew to new heights.\nThat isn't to justify such behavior. I have no illusion that a life of self-destructive behavior would stand the test of time. These days my energy comes from a place of self-love, where before my efforts came in large part from a deep-seated hatred of my self.\n====\ni had this experience on the twin lake trail where i felt so incredibly light, and perfectly centered and balanced, as if it were almost an unnecessary formality for my feet to touch the ground as i glided over the trail.\nI got so excited that i fell out of the that state, and never got back to the feeling nearly as intensely. But i know i will again, soon.\n======\nwe should subsidize enlightenment",
