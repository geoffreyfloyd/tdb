    "details": "I had a couple messed up molars on one side of my mouth for the longest time (about 4-5 years), and it caused me to need to always chew on the other side of my mouth.\n\nNow that it's been fixed for a few weeks, i've gotten myself back in the habit of chewing equally on both sides, and my jaw clicking problem seems to be completely gone (that was a real confidence killer).\n\nFelt so good to improve my well being that now i've made an appointment to get my wrist looked at, which has been so bad that i haven't been able to put my body weight on it for the last 8 months.\n\nAfter that (or maybe related to that), i'll get my shoulder treated, then hopefully be as good as new.\n==========================\nNext time Sable eats my underwear i'm going to make her take a shameful picture with them. REALLY, Sable. Just gross (but i love you anyway!)",
