Not just opening your mouth without a thought and blurting words, but truly striving to replicate EXACTLY the sounds that you hear in your mind. \n\nSinging is control of breath, and breath is quite literally life. \n\nDuring those moments that i most suck and fail at life, i am generally in the context of a bad breathing pattern. These bad breathing patterns, i think most will find, are much more common in our lives than situations and contexts in which we have a more relaxed and full breath.\n\nOften when we do new things, we never slow it down enough to adopt deep and accurate physiological learning, and instead adopt messy, jerky habits borne in large part from an insufficient demand of oxygen. It works \"well enough\", so we never strive to be able to command better control of our bodies in the context of this new thing. We just replay the same lousy actions, over and over.\n\nI still suck at singing, when compared to professional musicians, and maybe i always will, but learning better control of my breath has infinitely improved the quality of my life.\n\nI invite you to pay attention to your breath, and when you find yourself holding your breath in awkward jerky stutters while you are doing something, anything, just let it go and slow down whatever you are doing as slow as you must to allow a continuous flow of breath.","entry":"performed"}
