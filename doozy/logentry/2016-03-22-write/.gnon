Just standing here, my breath starts going back to bad habits (is this an inevitability of keeping your body immobile -- while your mind works alone?)\nWhen i was on vacation, we were always outside and on the move, and i feel the more uneven the landscape you are moving through, the more this balances out your inner sense of, well, balance.\nI begin to imagine our sense of self in our environment as this ever-jagged sphere that uses the fluidity of movement to keep it smoothed out and balanced.\n====\nall i ever really want to do is move my body, play outside, and observe all the life and animals i find. everything else is just waiting until i can, as the comforts of modern society just leave me feeling less than i am.",
