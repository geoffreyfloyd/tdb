On the other hand, my days this year of swimming in the creek before work are quickly coming to an end. Time to figure out a new morning routine to fit the coming season.\n\nI guess since i make enough money to float it on my own it's okay to randomly and without warning fuck me on the rent not even two weeks after we decide to renew the lease? I mean, all in all, ya i'll be alright, but wtf? I just want ya to be happy, but i'm seriously offended that i'm just now finding out, and just through a non-chalant conversation as if it was unimportant for me to know this shit. And what's worse the unspoken implication  that my super fucking bro deal of $400 a month (in an $1800 a month apartment) isn't worth the apparent pains of living with me :( You're currently the closest person to me in my life... I'm just really disappointed right now, and i feel like maybe i'm the biggest asshole roommate ever and she just won't tell me? I hope not, i mean, i know i'm fuckin weird as shit, but...\n\nMy momma told me when i was young to be a simple kind of man. Maybe not in so many words, but her simple small german town upbringing influenced me deeply. I'm seriously a fucking kid at heart, and that's not putting myself down, either. I'm proud of it. Be adventurous. Dream big. Spend every day doing what you love. And serious as fuck, maybe you should do some drugs, a little bit is good for ya, but only let drugs push the surreal in relation to how much you can legitimately push reality. Keep that balance in check. If you let drugs become the only way you push, then reality is gonna put your ass in check, and it's not gonna be fun.",
