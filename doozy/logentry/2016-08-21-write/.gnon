On the other hand, my days this year of swimming in the creek before work are quickly coming to an end. Time to figure out a new morning routine to fit the coming season.\n\nI guess since i make enough money to float it on my own it's okay to randomly and without warning fuck me on the rent not even two weeks after we decide to renew the lease? I mean, all in all, ya i'll be alright, but wtf? I just want ya to be happy, but i'm seriously offended that i'm just now finding out, and just through a non-chalant conversation as if it was unimportant for me to know this shit. And what's worse the unspoken implication  that my super fucking bro deal of $400 a month (in an $1800 a month apartment) isn't worth the apparent pains of living with me :( You're currently the closest person to me in my life... I'm just really disappointed right now, and i feel like maybe i'm the biggest asshole roommate ever and she just won't tell me? I hope not, i mean, i know i'm fuckin weird as shit",
