I think i just got a taste of what a lot of women must deal with somewhat commonly.\nAm i not cool enough to just be your friend? I guess good riddance, but it's still a bit disappointing, i wanted to believe our connection was based on better things than that, and then perhaps it could have grown to something more one day.",
