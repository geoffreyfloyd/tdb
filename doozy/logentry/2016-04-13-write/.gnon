Never kill an opportunity or idea with negative self talk before you've even tried to pursue it. When you really want something, you can summon otherworldly powers, AKA will, AKA the force, and failure is just the economics of natural life (and evolution) asking you how bad you really want it. And don't just go through the motions; if you're going to do it, then do it with everything you've got.",
