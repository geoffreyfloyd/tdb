Almost all conversation is just people employing others to listen to them talk to themselves.\nI try my best not to waste other people's time with this self-talk, and honestly, you should, too, because other people generally give very little fucks about the things that solely concern our self, and rightfully so.\nIf there is nothing to talk about that is a topic of mutual interest, i implore you to just stfu and enjoy the peace of the moment, rather than earfuck me with your self talk.",
