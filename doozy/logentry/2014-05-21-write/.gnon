    "details": "It’s funny to me how we can be so horrible at identifying the problem until we stumble on the solution.\n\nFour years ago i was overwhelmed with the distance between my world view and that of all the people i surrounded myself with, my fiancé (at the time) included. So much so that I had to run 2,000 miles away and spend the next three years primarily alone to give myself the space to live solely in the world i loved – far from the broken lives i loved but no longer had the energy to be a part of.\n\nThose three years were absolutely amazing, but as grand as the experiences were, i grew tired of never being able to share it with someone else. Not just anyone, mind you, but someone who shares the critical parts of my world view, and, above all, someone who understands a higher form of love that isn't willing to take from others what is not freely given - whether done consciously or not.\n\nThere would be moments i would meet others and be lifted with hopes that i had found one of my kind, but each time i would be disappointed to see the undeniable truth that i was still alone in my world. This is not a judgment against any person i had loved and left behind. It’s just a simple fact – they live in a world far too different than mine for me to feel anything but alone. Love them as i do, it wasn’t enough for me.\n\nAbout a year ago, my heart grew too weary for me to sustain the desire to be a part of this world. I became increasingly destructive to myself, seeking solace in chaos -- the simple satisfaction of tearing down the world i built for myself, like a boy smashing his LEGO masterpiece to bits after spending so much time and effort to make it what he had envisioned.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, i was able to pull myself together just enough to get my mother to go back to Germany, but just barely, and it was the last ‘cause’ i had given myself a year ago that i was committed to seeing through before my time here came to an end. She gave all of herself to my brother and i, and she deserved a new chapter in her life: one where she gives to herself. My brother would have only kept taking from her, and if it was the last thing i had done on this planet, it would be to right that wrong.\n\nOnce my mother moved to Germany, the chaos escalated. I was investing all the fruits of my labors into destroying my mortal coil as quickly as i could – and there was quite a bit of fruit to invest. \nThankfully, the universe put the one person in my life that i had been searching for, though i didn’t fully realize it yet. Truthfully, i already knew, partly by intuition and partly experienced, that her heart and lens – with which she views the world -- were the most beautiful i had ever known. My few moments alone with her filled my heart near to bursting, but i had grown so weary that i forgot what i had been searching for. And so i kept right on destroying myself bit by bit.\n\nIt wasn’t until i had pushed myself to the brink, and i had to say goodbye to her, that i was reminded of the question i had asked over a year before: what is the value of life when you cannot share it with one of your kind?\n\nMy desire to be here, to truly live, was reborn. Joy Lüring.\n===\nI'm feeling a little bit more like myself every day. Where before my smile would come only as a barrier to spare others of my pain, it now spills over from my joy. Though there is plenty more to change in my daily habits, i treat my body and mind better than i have in over a year. For the first time since i lost my physical proximity with Law Shappell and no longer had someone that shared a heart and lens of my ilk in my day-to-day life, i finally have someone in my life who i can share the pieces of me with that others will never know and appreciate. In that, i have regained a connection to the world, a desire to be alive, and the will to give my best.",
