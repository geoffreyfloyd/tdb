It's actually blowing my mind right now thinking of possible applications. It's like big-data, except instead of having to mine data for significant connections between unlikely sources, such connections will be naturally strengthened as the data grows and the connections are used.\n\nIt's kind of like a trail, the more often more people use it, the larger the trail becomes, then becoming a street, then a highway.\n\nWhen you need to get the data you need, the database has optimized itself to get it as quickly as possible",
