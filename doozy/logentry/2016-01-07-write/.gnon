    "details": "I need another me that is sociable; my reluctance to spend time talking to others is hindering my plans, which is really more of a reluctance to NOT do the 100 other things i could think to do with my time. \n\nMy version of love for all but the couple i allow to become attached to (Sable and Joy) has always been a physically separate love. I do indeed love them, and am usually quite willing to help any of them that i perceive to be helping themselves, and could still benefit from a helping hand, rather than just serving the unimaginative expectant. I don't need to be around them, i just like to see them smile and hear about the things that make them happy once in a while, i don't really need to be around them all the time.\n==========\neighties pop home office morning dance party\n=============\ni get paid to dance in front of my desk while i write code. the dancing is optional, but i prefer it.",
