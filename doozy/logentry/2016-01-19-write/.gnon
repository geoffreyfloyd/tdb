    "details": "one of the most common social offenses that myself and other musheens commit is missing social cues that prompt some form of response. \n\nus robots have a lot of data to process, and responding to hooman input is not always as high of a priority in my processing queue as it should be. \n\nonce i make my way to a hooman's request, the request has often expired and just gets tossed in the garbage collection\n\nwhile a patch doesn't exist to reprioritize my own attention, thankfully i can build other musheens that will give you all the attention you deserve.",
