With this idea in mind, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever that we should ever ask on a government form whether our primary ancestry comes from Anglo, African, or Latin, simply because it is completely irrelevant, and even though you can 'decline' it persists this idea in the back of our minds that perhaps it matters for something. No. Absolutely nothing should ever be measured by this.\n\nAlong that vein, i hate when a form makes me choose \"Mr.\", nobody calls me mister AND my name. If you don't know my name, hey MISTER might work.\n==============\n\nSo, the paycheck after the christmas party the company gave me the biggest christmas 'gift' i've ever gotten from a company.

Share and rate. Please note that unless otherwise noted, a prescribed routine should be given a fair full month before deciding. The reason that routines haven't worked in the past is that we are often short sighted and bad and making the changes we need to make.\n\nUI for adding repeated actions should have a stress level or some way of making it a natural part of the process of adding routines that you do not 'subscribe' to too much load at once. Small, simple changes and additions. For publicly shared routines, they can be rated by others (with the knowledge that it will show a user's accuracy in following the prescribed routine). Publicly shared routines will give you a count of how many people have subscribed to it (and perhaps the dates they subscribed or unsubscribed and what their accuracy level is at any given time - so the life habit coach or health professional can reach out to the subscriber, and the subscriber can reach out to them and ask questions).\n\n\nMarketing themes:\nOur human shortsightedness shortchanges us out of reaching our goals. Hold yourself accountable with Doozy.\n\nPossible alternate universe where i actually build a financial model to have a modest taxably for-profit business:\n- The first year is free, and you always own your data.\n- OR - health and life coach pros pay for their accounts\n- Hire musheens (paid hosting) or host your own.",
