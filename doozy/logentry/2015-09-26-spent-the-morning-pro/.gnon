    "details": "Spent the morning programming on doozy and doozy-log. Joy, Sable and i drove to Twin Lakes this afternoon and walked around both lakes. It was sunny and dry. We eventually made our way to Asher to pick up a growler of kolsch, then, with Sable in my arms for close to half the way, trekked back to the van and drove home. I spent more time later working on doozy.",
