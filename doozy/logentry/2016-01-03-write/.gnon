    "details": "A huge part of life is adopting and forming habits, beliefs, routines, and traditions. Given enough passage of time, the things we learned to do and believe over lifetimes and generations inevitably become outdated. They may no longer best serve our needs or may not reflect the most accurate facts to date. We may even forget just what need this action was meant to fulfill, why it was important, and the context behind the reasoning.\n\nThe action or belief is simply an empty shell without a confident, searched understanding.\n\nHere is a golden rule i feel strongly that every child should be taught at a young age to ensure they do not lose their flexibility in form and thought; so they may keep their habits relevant, fresh, and fruitful over the passage of time, enjoying a successful life, in whatever form success takes behind their own eyes:\n\nAll ideas are subject to re-analysis, and any attempt by others to deny the right to question its merit should be rebelled against and loudly denounced. Nothing and no one should ever hinder the evolution of thought. \n\nThat's it. As long as one allows oneself to believe that anything could possibly be done better, be more accurate, better descriptive of reality, or give one a better grasp on how to form their own reality, then one will never get old and brittle.\n\nI believe that when Jesus was written to have said ([TODO: get link ref]in the dead sea scrolls) that one should be as a child, this adaptive nature, this vibrant flexibility, is what he spoke to.\n\nAs the body and mind are one, yogis maintain a flexibility of mind as naturally as they have trained their bodies to remain fluid and in motion.\n\n=====================\n\nThere's many ways to look at something, but i find the best way is all of them.",
