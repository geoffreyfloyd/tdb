    "details": "Went hiking today, and on my way home on the bus, i was overcome with the beauty of being this physically and mentally exhausted, having pushed my body past its limits, out where no one can easily help me. There is a point i feel that my body hits when i do these kind of hikes where life is asking me how much i want this life, how deep is my breath, how decisive and true is my movement, and who am i? am i merely this body that is currently nagging my senses that it has had enough? or am i the ghost in the shell, the passenger, that decides how i shall move, knowing deep down that this body is going to be pushed, and as long as it draws breath, it's moving forward with every cell of my being.\nIt feels like every cell in my being is overjoyed by this reminder that i choose life.",
