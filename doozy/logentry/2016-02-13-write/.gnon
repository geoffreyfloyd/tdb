    "details": "# My dream (Best case scenario AKA Plan A)\n\nAfter saving up enough money and buying an adventure van, i start traveling and playing shows, blogging the entire journey and stopping at all the amazing places in nature, taking photos and videos on the way and sharing it.\n\nOnce i make it to Florida, a couple months in Brevard and catch Chelsea's eye once more. I show her a vision of a possible future, where we travel the world, blogging our adventure and playing shows, where we sing duets, and she starts playing the cello again.\n\nIn the meantime, in between shows i continue working on my open source project, putting it in the spotlight, showing the world a vision of a possible future, where we utilize machines to better the quality of our lives and manage our time in the ways most likely to reach our goals.\n\nThe thing about my dream, that makes it so grand, is that at some point i will need others to share it with me for it to become real.",
