I show her a vision of a possible future, where we travel the world, blogging our adventure and playing shows, where we sing duets, and she starts playing the cello again.\n\nIn the meantime, in between shows i continue working on my open source project, putting it in the spotlight, showing the world a vision of a possible future, where we utilize machines to better the quality of our lives and manage our time in the ways most likely to reach our goals.\n\nThe thing about my dream, that makes it so grand, is that at some point i will need others to share it with me for it to become real.","entry":"performed"}
