I didn't DO much that i remember back then, but i loved to LISTEN and WATCH; it was magical to me.\n\n*They called my dad Grego the Magician.* His companions were a dark haired, italian mustachioed man named Bob the Warlock, and a wizened long-haired and bearded old Wizard that went by the name of Joe (Only later in life did i realize he is obviously Gandalf the Grey). Since i hung around and absorbed their knowledge, i earned the honorary title, Geoffrey the Apprentice.\n\nDuring these magical years of my life, pretty much any given evening or weekend, if my dad was on the computer, i would be sitting right behind, looking over his shoulder while he hacked away on the keyboard, lounging in his lazyboy-to-computer desk setup, dressed in his robe and drinking coffee (that man knew how to party).\n\n*From hacking code to writing his own, i would watch intently as magic poured from his waggling fingertips.* When i was really young, he wrote me a smurfs game where you have to get through the level and avoid Gargamel, because he knew how much i loved the smurfs.\n\nLater, when my dad introduced my brother and i to a gem of a game named \"Dungeon Master\" on the computer, along with a myriad of other awesome fantasy games to come after, my dad would hack the games after we'd beaten them and give us awesome new items that we never knew existed. I remember him showing me how he found the patterns in the hex of the data source of our save files to figure out how to give us different items, or modify our stats.\n\nI remember this man vividly and miss him every day of my life.\n\nThanks, Dad, for inspiring me to become the great magician you always knew i would be.\n\n#simplemagic #theapprentice\n\n====\nI don't often waste time thinking about the past. One of the not so desirable side-effects of not thinking about the past, is that i forget the good as well as the bad, but something today triggered a strong set of memories of my fondest moments with my dad, before he gave up on life.\n\nI thought some of my closer friends on here may be interested to know one of the key sets of memories that shaped me.\n\n\n===============\n\nWhen you start writing and you think you're going to write something happy, funny, and witty, then next thing you know you're sobbing like your puppy just died.","entry":"performed"}
