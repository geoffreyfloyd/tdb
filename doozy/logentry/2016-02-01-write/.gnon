Growing up turns the episodes of our past into hilarious anecdotal videos. And it really never ends, every significant level of period of growth in our lives gives us another discarded version of our self to laugh at.\n==================================\nI knew it when i was a kid, and i never stopped believing as i got older. The path is still a long one, but the way is getting clearer and clearer, and i know beyond knowing that i am going to change the world. I suppose even if i didn't succeed, the belief has taken me much further than most.\n===================================\nI haven't bought a return ticket from NYC back home yet, this openendedness is exciting to me. Maybe i'll hit up the west coast before i go back to Boulder, or maybe a quick jaunt to the dirty south. Hell, as cheap as it is to travel around this time of year, maybe i'll do both.\n===========\nFocuses become normal tags, and tags can be hierarchical, so that any tag can have any number of parents and children. This way 'sunshine' can show up in more than one 'super' tag, usually a project or focus.","entry":"performed"}
