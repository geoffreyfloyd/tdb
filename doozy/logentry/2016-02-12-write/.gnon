I genuinely enjoy this, lol, i hope scientists look a close look at my brain when i'm gone, because i'm pretty certain something quite unique happened to mine at some point in my life.\n==============================================\nI don't say this lightly, in fact, i've gone a great portion of my life feeling 'less' than those who got a higher education than myself, but after spending this much time around other engineers in Boulder, i can say with confidence that i'm quite a bit more capable than most, when it comes to writing and understanding functional architectures.\n===\nHmm, apparently for valentine's weekend i've already started sucking my own dick... I'm old and i'm, quite expectedly, good at the thing i've been doing for at least 8 hours a day for over 11 years.",
