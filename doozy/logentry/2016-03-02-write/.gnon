    "details": "Upon waking, i can't even hate \"last night Geoff\" for his actions. To share a night with someone so beautiful, so intelligent, so cynical yet secretly hopeful... I truly know myself, and i know why i don't allow myself this one freedom, so that i may have every OTHER freedom that others let go of.. still, i can't lie to myself and say that it wasn't the most beautiful feeling to allow myself, even for a night, to believe that that kind of love is something i have room for in my life. I don't... I don't.",
