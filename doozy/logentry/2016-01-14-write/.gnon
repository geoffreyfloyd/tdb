    "details": "i found myself considering writing an app to auto-respond to my mother with \"love you too\" for her daily text check-ins.\non one hand, there is a knee jerk reaction inside that screams how wrong this is, but the other part feels that much of the things humans do to feel connected is wholly unnecessary.\ni ALREADY feel a connection to every living creature, probably deeper than many, but words are the cheapest form of expressing it, and i don't need reassurances to know i'm connected to an incredible, infinite force that often takes the shape of humans that i've come to know, love, and be quite fond of over my lifetime.",
