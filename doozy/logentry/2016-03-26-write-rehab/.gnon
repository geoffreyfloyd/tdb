Just as obesity is technically a disease, this too seems to me to be a disease of a sort, rooted in the years where all my activity was passive and dominant-hand-capable.\n\nThis problem bubbled up in the form of mild(muscular) scoliosis, and continued bubbling up in the form of multiple injuries, which severely exacerbated the issue, not to mention limited my movement and my happiness.\n\nIt always felt normal before, but now when i'm not in balance, the oddness of this tilted perspective occurs to me quite quickly. Sometimes i can actually FEEL subtle things, such as organs on the left side of my body not working as hard as the right; my right eye is being utilized more fully than my left eye, or my left lung isn't absorbing as much oxygen.\n\nA centering and breathing exercise dissolves these imbalances within minutes at most.\n\nThis has been a very interesting year in my experimentation and growth, and i'm very excited to see where it leads as i continue to increase my command over my body and mind.\n\nAnd i wonder if anyone else is suffering from this form of left-side idleness that leads to right-side overuse and injuries, the world needs to know the importance of ambidexterous health! ;)","entry":"performed"}
