    "details": "I just found myself daydreaming again about starting my own business, buying a nice recreational 4wd diesel, and living a minimalist, gypsy lifestyle on the road while i build my business. As i was imagining my tall frame occupying the tight space of a vehicle for a long length of time, and contrasting that with my current space, it finally occurred to me that i should accept the good life i've earned instead of looking for new ways to escape it.\n\nI'm a software engineer by trade, and although i have hobbies and projects that i'd love to spend a much larger portion of my time on, possibly even reaching a point where i could become successfully self-employed, it would likely be quite a long time before any of those avenues would earn me nearly as much as i earn now.\n\nWhile i truly wouldn't mind living on less income, especially in the context of a self-employed venture, i'm not willing to lessen the quality of my life to the point where i feel like i'm taking another step backwards.\n\nMaybe one day i'll start my own company, or maybe some other project will push itself to the forefront of my life, and it will be the clear and logical path to follow at that time, but until then, i'll just continue saving my money, working on my hobbies in my free-time, and enjoying my nice little place to call home in one of the most beautiful cities in America.\n\n=======================================\n\nSometimes i try to tell myself i don't really enjoy programming, but these are just passing feelings of monotony driven by short-sightedness, forgetting my innate need to create things. With code, i already having a mature skillset to create beautifully crafted logic, systems, and interfaces.\n\n\n, and daydream about my passions outside of the digital world; music, writing, and nature\n\n\n=========================================\nburritos are clearly the most practical and efficient vessel with which to transport a delicious meal into your mouth.",
