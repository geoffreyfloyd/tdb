I searched Craigslist and sent my resume to 2 companies in Boulder and 1 in Chattanooga. I included a pre-offer to relocate myself to quell any concievable hesitance based on my current location.\n\nChattanooga's prompt response confirmed my fears about my lack of formal education: \"sorry, we only hire college graduates\". I pretty much forgot all about the other companies. I didn't expect a response. Then, about a week later, i got a response from a Boulder company, which started the process that brought me here.\n\nThe way the rest of the story played out isn't really relevant to my point. My point is that everyday we kill beautiful opportunities by believing that it isn't possible, or by believing that it is improbable enough that we just ought not even try. And if we DO try, we've often already accepted that it won't happen, and so the lack of effort and forethought that could've meant success is lost, and we've failed before we even started.\n\nDon't spend your life accepting the things you cannot change; investing efforts in the things you CAN change will always get you farther.\n==================================\nI've created and destroyed at least 2 decent 'lives', and still managed to create a better life than i've ever known. It makes me happy to realize that i never really \"grew up\"; i'm still the same little kid that loved to build things (out of legos), then destroy it and clean up the pieces when i'm done, knowing i can always create something better tomorrow.",
