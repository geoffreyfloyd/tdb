I am a man that loves to lose myself in my efforts, and when i need help working out an issue, a seek the wisdom of the mountains. I really hope one day my main project, how i spend 90% of my free waking hours, will prove that i'm not quite the selfish, or self-centered man, that i can imagine many see me as. \n\nI feel so much love and respect for people that i usually opt to just leave them be, almost like a parent who feels like running up to their child and smother them with a hug and kiss, but knows they need to respect their child's space and let them grow. Just to see someone i care about pushing forward fills me withsuch strong feelings of joy and love.",
