    "details": "Passive aggressiveness is a means by which to damage someone's image of themselves, while remaining protected behind a curtain of passivity. If the one attacked responds with directness, rather than continuing the unwelcome game, then the attacker need only label their target as \"defensive\" in order to bury their shitty ass intentions for good, then, adding insult to injury, imply some darker intent on the target's defensiveness.\nIt's probably my least favorite game that humans play, and you only get to do it to me once before i cut you right the fuck out of my life.",
