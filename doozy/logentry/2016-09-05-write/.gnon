    "details": "Passive aggressiveness is a means by which to damage someone's image of themselves, while remaining protected behind a curtain of passivity. If the one attacked responds with directness, rather than continuing the unwelcome game, then the attacker need only label their target as \"defensive\" in order to bury their shitty ass intentions for good, then, adding insult to injury, imply some darker intent on the target's defensiveness.\nIt's probably my least favorite game that humans play, and you only get to do it to me once before i cut you right the fuck out of my life.\n===\nRemember the old school button mashing games, especially the racing ones, where the faster you mash it, the faster you go, and you'd basically put your hand into a controlled(?) mini seizure to go into hyper button mashing mode? That's what i feel like trying to play Classical Gas at about 300% of the original tempo right now, lol.",
