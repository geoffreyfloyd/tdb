Stimulation, a cause for interest in the moment, is what we all seek, in some form or the other, whether you're playing video games, drinking a beer, watching a movie, or smoking a joint.\n===================\nDon't ask yourself, \"Why go outside?\", ask, \"Why am i inside?\"\n===================\nI believe in the beginning, \"Gahhhd\" was merely the shape of breath that commonly escaped one's lungs when their senses were overwhelmed by beauty and wonder and connectedness, until one day, someone had the thought to call it by name and define to others in what ways they should experience it as well.\n\nNever let someone else define your \"gahd\" for you. That personal feeling is concrete only through experience, and any attempt to transpose its effect onto others would merely be subjective, only serving to cheapen it's value.",
