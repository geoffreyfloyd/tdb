    "details": "Hate speech, especially the intricately woven and veiled variety, makes me feel depressed, even more so when i see it being supported by family and friends. \nWho are the people producing this propaganda? \nWhat a horrible reality they must live in to be under constant oppression by such imaginary forces, a false reality that serves to do nothing but segregate themselves from their fellow man based on preferences that have absolutely no bearing for the content of one's character.\nAnd in the process they continue to poison the growing and impressionable minds of our children... Meh. If i could erase that part of humanity, cutting it off like a poisoned limb, i would do it.\n======\nWhen i find someone i know has hate in their heart towards a group of people that has no basis whatsoever for individual content of character, i ask myself:\nShould i accept them as they are and do my best to ignore the hate in their hearts?\nOr should i cut them out of my life, lest i inadvertently support, through the love and energy i give them, the poison they spread? Support the very same poison that was spread to them through another? Support another whom was regarded enough to have a voice with which to poison the minds of our impressionable youth?\nThe answer is clear once the question has been phrased. I cut them out of my life, as i would a poisoned limb. Let them see the world we envision has no place for hate, and it will be a lonely road they walk.",
