I can 'adult' with the best of them, but i'll never accept that it's simply how life should be.\n====================\nI've noticed that many of us live in the financial reality we create in our own minds. If you have a paycheck to paycheck mentality, it won't matter how much money you make.\n====================\nIn this whole linear-time shindig that we're all a part of, it's a pretty good time to be Geoff.\nGeoff has had some really dark moments, a LOT of colorful moments, and a great many beautiful moments, but for the first meaningfully measurable span of time in Geoff's linear existence (or at least since he was too young to ponder such nonsense), Geoff believes he deserves these beautiful moments as much as anyone else, even compared to those great men whom he commonly acknowledges to have lived a much more meaningful existence than himself.\nAnd this is also the last linear moment that Geoff ever refer to himself in the third person.\n","entry":"performed"}
