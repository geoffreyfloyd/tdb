    "details": "a man packs his foliage bag and water bottle and heads out the door to take on a day of work.\n\nit's 2:00pm now, and he takes a stroll down a nearby nature trail, surrounded by nature as he lazily chomps away at his vegetables and foliage, giving his mind and body a brief chance to 'reset' at the time when the chemicals in our brain hit their lull<reference link>, causing most of us to notice sleepiness. \n\nRefreshed now, he steps back in ready to go.\n\n===================================================================\n\nI prefer to walk while i eat, and i prefer to stand when i sit.\n\n===================================================================\n\nA man in the common tatter of a vagabond asks a man for change:\n\n\t\"Tell you what, i'll give you a few bucks if you tell me a good story about yourself. Anything at all, but i'd really love to hear about your proudest moment if you don't have a better story.\"\n\nThe vagabond, seeing the sincerity in his eyes, recounts a fine tale. Inspired and pleased by the tale, the man shakes his hand firmly, giving him a $20 bill, and wishes him well in his passage.\n\nThis should be a common story. What people most need is human connection, and to be treated like any delightfully pleasant person. I feel that avoiding eye contact when you've been addressed, refusing to acknowledge their existence, is extremely socially and emotionally damaging. Stories connect us.\n\nFrom now on when someone asks for a few dollars, i will offer to trade them a few dollars for a story about themselves, any at all, but i like the ones about your happiest moments.",
