Anything at all, but i'd really love to hear about your proudest moment if you don't have a better story.\"\n\nThe vagabond, seeing the sincerity in his eyes, recounts a fine tale. Inspired and pleased by the tale, the man shakes his hand firmly, giving him a $20 bill, and wishes him well in his passage.\n\nThis should be a common story. What people most need is human connection, and to be treated like any delightfully pleasant person. I feel that avoiding eye contact when you've been addressed, refusing to acknowledge their existence, is extremely socially and emotionally damaging. Stories connect us.\n\nFrom now on when someone asks for a few dollars, i will offer to trade them a few dollars for a story about themselves, any at all, but i like the ones about your happiest moments.","entry":"performed"}
