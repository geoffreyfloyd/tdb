    "details": "I often play a game of a sort, it occurred to me, and i wonder if anyone else does this: I like doing the simplest things around the home, let's say putting away leftovers in right-size containers. And i do this in such a exact way as to constantly challenge the bounds of what my mind and body considers as the 'correct' sequences of muscles firing and hierarchical and multi-relational ideas accessed and predicted. A simple and imperfect example perhaps, but the one in context, would be to predict how much volume the food would have to take up, so that it can be stored in the most perfect fitting container, that is, the smallest allowable that fits the entire leftover dish.\n=============\n\"Look.. I know we need to fix a lot of broken systems that have been damaged by corporate greed. But when you suggest the Barter system as a solution, and actually consider that economics, an entire branch of knowledge, a system evolved over our history to solve the genuine challenges faced in an efficient exchange of resources, should be rolled back to how it was before the Bronze Age, instead of evolved forward into one that considers a more accurate model and keeps up with our evolving moral obligations, i feel like you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.\", is what i WISH i had said, but instead i softly nodded my head and conceded the only truth i felt was worth giving, \"interesting.\"\n=================\nI feel like i need to become a bit more presumptuous, if i'm going to get everything i want out of this life. I can presume anything that involves only myself, but anytime it involves others, i can barely think to dare that another would be interested in what i have to offer, unless they were to frankly tell me they were.",
