I don't set aside nearly as much time recognizing my achievements as i do (mostly constructively) criticizing my faults, and although i don't make much time to keep up with other people, i really love humanity with all my being. I suppose feeling appreciated is always nice, but those words were more than i could have ever hoped for from anyone, and i had to stop her rant before i started crying like a little schoolkid. ;)","entry":"performed"}
