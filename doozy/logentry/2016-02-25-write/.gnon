    "details": "Tonight my roommate, although a bit intoxicated (unprecedented, she never really drinks or smokes), said (well, ranted really) literally the nicest thing to me that anyone could ever say to another human being.\nShe told me that i was the greatest all around human being she's ever personally known, and thanked me for giving her the opportunity to live in Boulder and save money while she's here.\nI mean, that is pretty HUGE to me. I don't set aside nearly as much time recognizing my achievements as i do (mostly constructively) criticizing my faults, and although i don't make much time to keep up with other people, i really love humanity with all my being. I suppose feeling appreciated is always nice, but those words were more than i could have ever hoped for from anyone, and i had to stop her rant before i started crying like a little schoolkid. ;)",
