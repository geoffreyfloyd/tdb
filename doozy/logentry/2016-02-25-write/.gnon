I get down on myself for succumbing to superficial ideas whenever i catch myself, and i probably don't set aside nearly as much time recognizing my achievements as i do spending time (constructively) criticizing my faults, and although i don't make much time to keep up with other people, i really love humanity (and what i think it is capable of) with all the heart i have.","entry":"performed"}
