I like to remind myself (when i don't \"feel\" like doing something) that when it comes to a living life, pleasure is optional, but satisfaction is not.\nIf one learns to find pleasure (even just a moment of conscious satisfaction in a job well done) in both difficult and routine tasks alike, the quality of one's life can soar to the heights they'd perhaps once imagined, but could never quite grasp.",
