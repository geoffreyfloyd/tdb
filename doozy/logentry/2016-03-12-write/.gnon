    "details": "In the last week i've had incredible episodes of feeling almost superhuman, like i completely belonged in my body and i could bid it to do anything, and all my inner will would push the limits.\nI've been mostly silent about this, because i've been trying to pinpoint this last piece of the puzzle that is wiggling into place, and after another rehab session of symmetrical movement, i was conscious of the 'activation' of the left back neck and shoulder, as if it had previously been left 'powered down'. Simply moving around my left arm does not seem to require some portion of muscles in my upper left back, so it spends its life calcifying in neglect.\nI believe that the average modern lifestyle (or perhaps just an undisciplined computer-desk-environment lifestyle) encourages one-side-dominant movement to the point that i, and perhaps others, have made a deep neural connection in our motor movement regions to defer all movement to the right upper side of my body.\nThe reason i have failed to correct this for so long, is that i have been focusing on the right side of my body as the issue, when all along the right side was merely the consequence of overuse, due to the left side of my body remaining in a powered down state.\nI've somehow danced around this problem for so long. Here are some other observations:\n- Once i consciously activate that part of my body, my left sinus begins opening back up.\n- My thinking seems to clarify\n- My voice and breath improves dramatically\n- Yesterday, when i didn't take the time to activate my upper left region, my voice was not at all impressive, as it had been the days before.\n- Sometimes it feels like my entire spine needs to extend itself to its fullest and literally pull itself over to the left a bit (perhaps to balance out its alignment with my nervous system).\n================\nI've spent over 4 years trying to rehabilitate my body, and although there were injuries that set me back along the way, it finally hit me that i'd been looking at it wrong the entire time. I'd focused on the symptom (the right side of my body would feel sore and out of place), instead of the root problem (an entire set of muscles in the left side of my back and neck seem to not fire when they should, adding additional strain to the right side and making symmetrical balance at the center of my being (my spine) impossible. Consequences from this imbalance spilled into multiple physical ailments, poor muscle control, improper breathing, left kidneys not seeming to work as well as they should, left lung not inflating evenly with the right side.\n================\nOne of the head software engineers has made it all but clear that she doesn't like me and has stripped out all the niceties in our interactions.\nI suppose i can't blame her, because i'm the one that has to constantly point out how poorly designed her code is.\nShe can dislike me all she wants, but she can't deny the quality of her code has been improving since i've been here to light a fire under her ass.\nYou're welcome.",
