            "text": "“Tell me, Xenophon, what opinion have you hither to had of Critobulus? Have you placed him in the rank of the temperate and judicious; or with the debauched and imprudent?”\n“I have always looked upon him,” answered Xenophon, “to be a very virtuous and prudent man.”\n“Change your opinion,” replied Socrates, “and believe him more rash than if he threw himself on the points of naked swords or leapt into the fire.”\n“And what have you seen him do,” said Xenophon, “that gives you reason to speak thus of him?”\n“Why, he had the rashness,” answered Socrates, “to kiss the son of Alcibiades, who is so beautiful and charming.”\n“And is this all?” said Xenophon; “For my part, I think I could also willingly expose myself to the same danger he did.”\n“Wretch, that you are!” replied Socrates. “Do you consider what happens to you after you have kissed a beautiful face? Do you not lose your liberty? Do you not become a slave? Do you not engage yourself in avast expense to procure a sinful pleasure? Do you not find yourself in an incapacity of doing what is good, and that you subject yourself to the necessity of employing your whole time and person in the pursuit of what you would despise, if your reason were not corrupted?”\n“Good God” cried Xenophon, “this is ascribing a wonderful power to a kiss for sooth.”\n“And are you surprised at it?” answered Socrates. “Are there not some small animals whose bite is so venomous that it causes insufferable pain, and even the loss of the senses?”\n“I know it very well,” said Xenophon, “but these animals leave a poison behind them when they sting.”\n“And do you think, you fool,” added Socrates, “that kisses of love are not venemous, because you perceive not the poison? Know that a beautiful person is a more dangerous animal than scorpions, because these cannot wound unless they touch us; but beauty strikes at a distance.”"
