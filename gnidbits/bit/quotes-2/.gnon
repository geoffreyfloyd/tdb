A rose? What could that be?\nIs it a flower or a rock? \n\nWhy do we treat the fleeting day\nwith so much needless fear and sorrow?\nIt's in its nature not to stay:\nToday is always gone tomorrow. \n\nWith smiles and kisses, we prefer\nto seek accord beneath our star,\nalthough we're different (we concur)\njust as two drops of water are."
