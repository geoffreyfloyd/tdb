Livingston Larned\ncondensed as in \"Readers Digest\"\n\nListen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little\npaw crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily\nwet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone.\nJust a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the\nlibrary, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily\nI came to your bedside.\n\nThere are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross\nto you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because\nyou gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to\ntask for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when\nyou threw some of your things on the floor.\n\nAt breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You\ngulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You\nspread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off\nto play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand\nand called, \"Goodbye, Daddy!\" and I frowned, and said in\nreply, \"Hold your shoulders back!\"\n\nThen it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came\nup the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles.\nThere were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before\nyour boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the house.\nStockings were expensive-and if you had to buy them you would\nbe more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father!\n\nDo you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how\nyou came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes?\nWhen I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption,\nyou hesitated at the door. \"What is it you want?\" I snapped.\n\nYou said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge,\nand threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your\nsmall arms tightended with an affection that God had set\nblooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither.\nAnd then you were gone, pattering up the stairs.\n\nWell, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped\nfrom my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. What\nhas habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of\nreprimanding-this was my reward to you for being a boy. It\nwas not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too\nmuch of youth. I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own\nyears.\n\nAnd there was so much that was good and fine and true in your\ncharacter. The little heart of you was as big as the dawn\nitself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous\nimpulse to rush in and kiss me good night. Nothing else matters\ntonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and\nI have knelt there, ashamed!\n\nIt is feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these\nthings if I told them to you during your waking hours. But\ntomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer\nwhen you suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my\ntongue when impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it\nwere a ritual: \"He is nothing but a boy-a little boy!\"\n\nI am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you\nnow, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are\nstill a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother's arms, your\nhead on her shoulder. I have asked too much, too much."}],"videos":[]}
